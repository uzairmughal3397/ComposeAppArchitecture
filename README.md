# ComposeAppArchitecture
ComposeAppArchitecture is a comprehensive template project that demonstrates the integration of essential Android development components, utilizing Jetpack Compose for the UI, Room Database for local data storage, Hilt for dependency injection, DataStore for data persistence, and Retrofit for API calls. 
## Features

- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern toolkit for building native UI.
- **Retrofit**: A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- **ViewModel**: Manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
- **Hilt**: Dependency Injection library for Android.
- **DataStore**: Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution that provides a modern alternative to SharedPreferences.
